A repo for labs done in ECSE426 Microprocessor Systems

The lab assumes the use of the Discovery MB997B board with an ARM M4 processor.

Lab1: Kalman Filter Implementation
The board was not used in this lab.

Lab2: Temperature Sensor Sampling
Used the Systick Hardware timer to sample the sensor data.
Used LEDs on the board to display changes.

Lab3: Accelerometer Sensor Sampling
Used External Interrupts and Hardware Timers to sample the accelerometer data and display it to a 7-segment display.
Also used a 4x4 keypad to input angles.

Lab4: CMSIS RTOS RTX
Put the previous labs together using the CMSIS RTOS for thread management.
